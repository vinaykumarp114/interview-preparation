Given a tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. Write a method hasPath(Node n, int sum) that returns boolean.
e.g in the above tree has hasPath(n,22) will return true. where n is the root node.

Also, find the paths that evaluate to that sum e.g. in the above e.g. for sum 22 :
5->4->11->2 and 5->8->4->5. We need to access the available paths (store the paths).

NOTE: Tree has integral values, a node may not have both right & left children. Tree is not balanced.
