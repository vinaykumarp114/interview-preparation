The Problem:
 
There is a data structure that holds object of type Item.
 
Item object has the attributes name and description. When the object is created, name will be “JustCreated” and description will be “Item Just Created”.
 
There is one thread that creates these item object and adds it to the data structure.
 
There are three separate threads that manipulate the item object.
 
Thread one has the method modify that first checks the data structure size, then grabs hold of each object (traversing from 0 to size-1) and changes the name to “Modify-Thread1” and description to “Modified by Thread 1”.
 
Thread two has the method modify that checks the data structure size and then grabs items in a reverse fashion from (size-1 to 0) and changes the name to “Modify-Thread2” and the description “ Modified by Thread 2”.
 
Thread three creates a random index (index between 0 and size of datastructure-1) and deletes the object.
 
Things to Check:
 
·         Overall Design

·         Patterns Used

·         Prevent Dead-lock

·         Prevent Out-of-Bounds

·         Prevent Null Pointers
